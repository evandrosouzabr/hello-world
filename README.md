# hello-world
Hi, fellows!

I'm Evandro Souza. I live in Manaus, Amazonas' state capital.
I work as Coordinator of Operations and IT Infrastructure section of Labour Justice's Tribunal of 11th Region.
I'm learning how to use github because I want to improve my programming skills and file versioning.
